# Full Stack Frameworks Project

The project I created for Code Institute's final Full Stack Frameworks conclusion project was based on an online art gallery. The purpose of this site was to showcase a range of prints and allow the user to purchase them, using Stripe authentication. I named this fictional online store 'CITIZEN9'.
 
## UX
 
I started the UX process by looking at a variety of different popular online shops, such as ASOS, Amazon and Society6 to see how a user would navigate their shopping experience. I then focused on how the shopping basket was structured and the ease of the buying processs.

I then created my user stories based on looking at these sites and from watching the videos in the course content. I wanted to create a 'clean' look and feel to the website, with easy navigation at the top.

The user stories and low-fidelity wireframes are located in the UI/UX folder.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

1. [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
* Used to create low-fidelity wireframes.
2. [Bootstrap](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
* Robust front-end library for HTML, CSS and JS.
3. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
*  For appealing typography.
4. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
*  The project uses jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
5. [Python](https://www.python.org/)
*  The backend programming language.
6. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* High-level Python Web framework.
7. [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
* pip is the package installer for Python
8. [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/)
* A JavaScript grid layout library.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.


## Credits

I followed, with merticulous detail, the instructions on how to build an online shop in the course content. I would like to give credit to mentor support, who pointed me in the right direction if I became stuck.

### Content

I initially wanted to use the 'Art Images: Drawing/Painting/Sculptures/Engravings' dataset from Kaggle. Unfortunately, however this was just not suitable for my purpose, so I had to create my own dataset. 
I started by looking at images from the open source website unsplash.com and then modeled my JSON on the course demonstration.

The content is entirely fictional and created by myself, therefore it is very limited. I would ideally have liked a huge database of artworks available to the user, but for all intents and purposes it showcases a limited 
number of artworks and demonstrates the purpose of the site.

### Media

All images for this project were obtained from the open source platform unsplash.com [https://unsplash.com/].

### Acknowledgements

- I received inspiration for this project from Society6 [https://society6.com/] and Artfinder [https://www.artfinder.com/]. I'd like to acknowledge Code Institute for providing very thorough instructions on how to complete this online shop.
